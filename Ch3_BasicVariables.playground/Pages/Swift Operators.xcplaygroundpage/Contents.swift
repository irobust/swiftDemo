 # Basic Operators

 ## Topic Essentials
 Operators in Swift are used to perform various functions, such as value assignments, mathematics, equality and logic comparisons, and declaring ranges.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Understand the different operators and their basic uses
 */
// Arithmetic (+, -, /, *)
var ans = 5 - 4 + 3


// Remainder/Modulo
var mod = 3 % 8


// Compound assignments (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
var a = 10
a += 10


// Comparisons (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
var c = 10, d = 20
c == d


// Ternary operators
var points = (c > 10) ? 5: 0;


// Logical operators (!, &&, ||)
var isActive = false;
isActive = !isActive

// Ranges
/*
 Closed Range: 1...5
 Half-Open Range: 1..<5
 */
var range = 1...5
var openRange = 1..<5
